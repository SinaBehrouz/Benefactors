CMPT 470 - WEB-BASED INFORMATION SYSTEMS

set up:
- need to install flask and flask restful modules (can do easily via pip)
- Flask will recognize "app.py" as the default file to run, if its not specified then you must change the    FLASK_APP token, in your environment, to your python file.
  - export FLASK_APP="filenameHere.py"
- can run your file of choice by running command "python filenameHere.py" (may have to do python3 instead of python)
  - e.g python first.py (or python3 first.py)

- if you have any issues with configuration, message me @sgulati (simran)
