To run a flask app: 
- need to install flask and flask restful modules (can do easily via pip)
- can run your file of choice by running command "python filenameHere.py" (may have to do python3 instead of python)
  - e.g python first.py (or python3 first.py)

- if you have any issues with configuration, message me @sgulati (simran)
